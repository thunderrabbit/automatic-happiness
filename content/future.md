Title: "Future plans"

### 　● [Triple Splitter](/p/ts)

The bars of the [Triple Splitter](/p/ts) sort the marbles correctly, but I still need to:

* make enough space for the small marbles to pass under the bar and down the [Little Wiggly Track](/p/lwt).
* make a track to catch the medium marbles when they fall through the triple splitter.

### 　● [Outer Spiral](/p/os)

Feeding into the [Triple Splitter](/p/ts), the [Outer Spiral](/p/os) will circumnavigate the entire track.  Large and medium marbles will roll around the entire track in a clockwise motion (as seen from the top), and small marbles will feed into the triple splitter from the other direction, though I don't know exactly how far around the track they will go.

One idea I just now had is to allow the small marbles to circumnavigate the track on an inner loop, going the opposite direction.

Right now [Reversible Guy](/rg) is waiting for the glue to dry while he is holding the first support that will hold up the [Outer Spiral](/p/os).

Though the stand-in [Outer Spiral](/p/os) is a polygon of sorts, I plan to make the real spiral smoother somehow.

### 　● [Lower(*) Zig Zag](/p/lzz)

Next to the triple splitter, I have a very narrow space to allow the small marbles to go down to feed into the small marble resting area from the other direction off of the [Little Wiggly Track](/p/lwt).

(*) Though there are not currently any plans for an upper zig zag, I guess there might have to be one later in the construction.

# Past plans

* Make a stand-in [Outer Spiral](/p/os).   I originally tried to do large segments of the spiral with long bamboo sticks, but they split while being curved.  I ended up using shorter bamboo skewers, which make it more of a polygon than a smooth spiral.

* Make a triple splitter.  The trickiest bit was getting the spacing correct.  As of about August 2018, the spacing is correct.

* Have the bearing fly in like a helicopter.  This was done by suspending it from a broom handle mounted above the whole set.

* Have the stage on a bearing.  This allows me to easily reach the far side of the stage to pose the characters / glue stuff / etc while making the animation.
