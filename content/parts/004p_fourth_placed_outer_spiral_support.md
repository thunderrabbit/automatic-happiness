This piece is the first to not be placed at the full height it needs
to be for the [Outer Spiral](/p/os), but will first hold the
[Caret Splitter Feeder](/p/csf) and then be extended vertically a
bit to hold the Outer Spiral.

The Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support was glued into place near the
end of the aptly named livestream

History:

* 29 Nov 2018: the piece is in place, and has been glued by Mr McGlue.

* 20 Nov 2018: though Mr McGlue is listed as having
helped, and the piece has been glued, Mr McGlue has not actually glued
the piece in place in the snippet (Take 10 in Dragonframe, Snippet 7
in [mt3s](https://mt3s.marbletrack3.com)).
