This piece will essentially roll small and medium marbles from the
middle of the track to bounce off the [outer spiral](/p/os) and then into the
[Caret Splitter](/p/cs) via its [Extension](/p/csfe) and [Feeder](/p/csf).

Will be supported by the [Caret Splitter Feeder Extension Reflection Stanchion](/p/csfers).
