These pieces were removed from the [Triple Splitter](/p/ts) because they stuck
too far past the edge the stage.  At the time of their removal, there
was no specific plan to use them.

Over a year later in realtime, and about 10 minutes later in
movie-time, they were picked up by Squarehead to act as supports /
[guides](/p/gibrmlz) on the [Medium Catcher Below Triple Splitter](/p/mcbts).

History:

* 2019 Jan 01: These became [Guides into Back Right Medium Landing Zone](/p/gibrmlz)
