The Caret Splitter Right Hand Inner Side should keep small marbles on
track once they eventually can use the right hand side of the
[Caret Splitter](/p/cs).  The plan is to use the [Caret Splitter Rudder](/p/csr) to push the pieces
towa... oh that won't work well UNLESS the medium marbles push the
rudder and ensure they themselves will only go down the track IFF the
rudder is pushed toward the right, to send them down toward the left.
