It was tricky to put this rail into the right place given the characters I had on hand, so I brought in two Snakes so they could hold it steady while the other characters installed supports and glued it in place.  This piece runs right above the [First Track](/p/tft), and is just barely out of the way of Large Marbles, and in the way of Medium Marbles.

As of this writing, the First Snake-Installed Rail works fine for medium marbles, but it does *not* work for Small Marbles, so I need to work out a way to do that.  I hope a thin bamboo piece will work, because that would be easiest to install.
