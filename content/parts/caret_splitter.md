The Caret Splitter sits opposite the (top of the) [Triple Splitter](/p/ts).  It is the small section of track which spans the end of the medium marble resting point which does *not* involve the [Triple Splitter](/p/ts).  I named it Caret Splitter because it is shaped like vaguely like a caret ^.  It is actually shaped more like the Japanese character へ, when viewed from the direction the marbles will reach it.

#### Construction History

* 25 December 2018: Added [Bar Below Circle by Caret Splitter](/p/bbcbcs) which will keep small marbles on track.
* 17 December 2018: Added [Circle by Caret Splitter](/parts/circle_by_the_caret_splitter/) which will hold a bar to keep small marbles on track.
* November 2018: The medium marbles work perfectly (~100% of the time), but [the small marbles work 0% of the time](/episode/2018/november/glued-two-more-toothpicks-on-lower-zig-zag/).  If the small marbles hit the left side, they fall willy nilly.  If they hit the right side, they get stuck.
