The First Track is made of two bamboo skewers.  Its placement bicsects the stage, and guides all the other tracks on the lowest level.

After [Francois kicked the stage in place](/episode/2017/september/francois-kicked-the-stage-into-place/), the First Track supports were put into place by [Candy Mama](/w/cm), who slid its supports in like hockey pucks sliding across ice.  The Brothers actually placed the First Track before The First Roll.
