I found an old character from five or six years ago when I first
attempted a video of the construction of Marble Track 3.

I have named him Backpack Jack in English, and probably ルックくん in
Japanese.

He's helpfully carrying a bamboo skewer to be used as the [Triple
Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf).

Candy Mama is on her way to pick it up from him, but first she has to
go around the end of the Triple Splitter, not because she is not
ghostable as needed, but because the
[Seventh Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/7poss) does not yet exist.
It is going to hold the top end of the [Triple
Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf) as well as the 20th-or-so segment of
the outer spiral (once it exists).

Backpack Jack has had a lot of trouble holding the bamboo skewer which
will be the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](/p/tssf), but it has not
been tooo terribly difficult to keep him upright on the way up the
ramp.  (Just slightly difficult.)
