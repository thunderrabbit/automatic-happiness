Mr Greene is named after the drawing I made for Chris.

He is about the same size as Dr Sugar, so maybe they can be partners
of a sort.  Is Mr Greene a nurse?  Is Dr Sugar a woman?

Right at the moment, Mr Greene is climbing up onto the stage to help
Dr Sugar put together the [Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz), but I am super
pressed for time if I want to get anything done before the stage
rotates around again.  I guess they will be working on it for a full
rotation.

Mayumi suggested it would be neat if the snakes did something
together.  I think I will have the currently-spiraling snake snuggle
up with the currently-resting snake.  That will take some of the
animation pressure off.  They can go on some adventure later.
