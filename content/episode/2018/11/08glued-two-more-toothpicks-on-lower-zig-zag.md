I glued two more toothpicks on the [Lower Zig Zag](/lzz) today.
[Dr Sugar](/w/ds) will be able to test the Lower Zig Zag soon, and will
find it fails, but will hopefully get it to work by the time the Lower
Zig Zag comes around to the front of the scene again.

[Pinky](/w/pink) will push the medium marble up the ramp above the [Caret Splitter](/p/cs)
to test, and will find that the medium marble works perfectly, because
it does.`(*)`  In real life. Perfectly, every time.

[G Choppy](/w/gc) has his sword raised, poised to cut the chopped chopstick that
[Reversible Guy](/w/rg) placed haphazardly in what turns out to be *exactly the
right spot* for the [Outer Spiral](/p/os).  This will be the third support for
the outer spiral.  After cutting this one, G Choppy will cut the stick
[Mr Greene](/w/mg) has just swung around, lifting Square Head up from being
pulled around the track.

In other words, things are running quite smoothly on the track.  But,

`(*)` the small marble does *not* work near the Caret Splitter.  If it
falls to the left, it tumbles out onto the large marble track.  If it
falls to the right, it gets stuck behind the first support for the
Outer Spiral.

I have not yet figured out how to deal with the left-hand side in a
way that still lets the medium marble perfectly go down the track.
Plus, I have no idea how I will handle the right-hand side.  Not sure
if I will, but as I write this, I am thinking about taking pictures of
the two.....  oh I know.  I should take video of it and post it online
somewhere.  Little snippets of live video.

Here is the [second live stream from this day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhopfe-_tFk).
