Today before lunch I did
[a livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tzMgVT_6oY) in which
toothpicks moved themselves up toward the [Lower Zig Zag](/lzz), where
they will be rails on the second level of the Zig Zag, while the two
toothpicks which had been so fiddly before were cut by [G-Choppy](/w/gc)
and glued into place (by me, not yet by [Mr McGlue](/mmg)).

During this time, coming up from the camera point of view,
[Candy Mama](/w/cm) is leading the brothers onto the set, with something
which looks suspiciously like it might be the ramp to get onto the
stage.  (Mainly because it is the ramp.)

*And*, after ghosting through the triple splitter, [Mr Greene](/w/mg)
has picked up the chopstick carried onto the stage by
[Squarehead](/square), who is currently being pulled around the stage
with his hand caught in something, and will soon inadvertantly help
Squarehead stand upright again with the chopstick.

All of that was before lunch!

After lunch, I did a [second livestream](https://youtu.be/pOOpjwUYhqk) the same
day, during which [Reversable Guy](/w/rg) added a guide to keep marbles
on the lower central track (which runs adjacent to the lowest track
for large marbles).

Here are the frames taken yesterday.  Some of them (two?) will not be
used.
