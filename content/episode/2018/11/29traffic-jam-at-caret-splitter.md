Today I broadcast for over an hour, during which I got maybe 8 frames
taken.

Very glad that I left notes for myself to get started quickly, and I
hope the notes I left will help me get started again.  Maybe I should
scan those notes.  They were basically plans for upcoming stuff.

There is a bit of a challenge in how to get Squarehead up to add onto
the Caret Extension while Reversible, G Choppy, and Mr McGlue  are
working on the [Fifth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/5poss).

In the back of the set, I bent two toothpicks which will be part of
what I am calling [Lower Zig Zag Net](/p/lzzn), though it does not
exist yet.
