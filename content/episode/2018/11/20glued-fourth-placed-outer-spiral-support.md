Today I glued the [Fourth Placed Outer Spiral Support](/p/4poss) after
[G Choppy](/w/gc) cut it.

In the background the orange marble has rolled off the top of the
[Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz), where [Mr Greene](/w/mg) is going to help
build an LZZ Catcher.

Here are the frames from today.  Just 3 in 30 minutes; the first one
was missing something!
