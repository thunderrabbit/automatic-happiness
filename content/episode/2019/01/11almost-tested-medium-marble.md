I was a bit rushed for time at the end of this, and ended up stopping
just after I taped a thread around the green marble to it could be
suspended after just coming off the
[Medium Catcher Below the Triple Splitter](/p/mcbts).

To be honest, I forgot to take a picture, but this is from the next
day of filming.
