Dr Sugar is the manager.  He was the first person to come on to the set in the first attempt to create Marble Track 3 back in 2011 or so.

Though Dr Sugar has really short arms, he is also quite gymnastic and can flip around and move relatively easily around different parts of the track.

Dr Sugar's TODO list:

* Dec 2018: Working with [Mr Greene](/w/mg) on [Lower Zig Zag Net](/p/lzzn)
* Nov 2018: ~~working on making the [Lower Zig Zag](/p/lzz)~~
* ~~trying to get the triple ball splitter to be sized correctly.~~
