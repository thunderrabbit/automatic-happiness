Super Spoony head is a relatively new character whose job is to bring marbles to the stage. His head is made from a spoon so it holds marbles well.

I created him because the large marbles are *so heavy* compared to the characters themselves, so it's quite difficult to actually let them carry the marbles up the ramp.

He's designed to be sturdy, and just the right height to allow the marbles to roll off the spoon and onto the stage.
