Mr McGlue has a very specific job.  He glues pieces of wood together.  He has one long arm which he uses to deliver glue.  He stands upright on two feet, but the one on his arm side is really small.

Mr McGlue is a ghostable character, meaning (for my
convenience) he can pass through wooden sticks.  As the track
construction moves along, Mr McGlue's big feet were making it more and
more difficult to let him pass through most areas of the track.  I had considered removing his big
shoes, but they are glued to his feet in a way that would damage his
feet too much.  So on 29th of September 2018 [I made a copy of Mr McGlue](/episode/2018/september/three-mr-mcglues/) with short feet.

Mr McGlue, meet Mr McGlue.
